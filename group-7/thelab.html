      <h1>The Lab</h1>
      <p>Carter P.O.V</p>
      <p>I sat in my office chair wheeling around the room picking up random equipment I needed. "Cyrus how's the gun?" I called from across the lab.</p>
      <p>"It's going great!" he called back, I smiled using some tweezers to touch up the wires of the high tech wepon.</p>
      <p>"Perfect," I muttered holding the two halfs of the gun rolling over to the welding section of the small shop, I pulled the welding mask over my face and conected the two halfs of the wepon. Sparks flew everwhere and I smiled under the mask.</p>
      <p>I yanked the mask off my face and dropped on the floor my breath caught as I stared down at the beautiful material.</p>
      <p>"Wowwwwwwwww, it's so pretty." I spun on my heel and my fist made contact with their stomach.</p>
      <p>"Carter that hurt like the dikens!" Cyrus yelped cluching his stomach.</p>
      <p>"Sorry man," I said lifting him off the floor.</p>
      <p>"I'mma tell your mommy that you boolien my tummy!" He yelled running twords the door like a small child.</p>
      <p>"You stupid boy." I shook my head chucking.</p>
      <p>"You dumb girl," He retorted snorting in the prossess.</p>
      <p>"Shut up and help me," I gestured to all the swords, guns, staffs, and other things on the table.</p>
      <p>"Can we take an ice cream break." He pleaded on his knees his hands interlocked together.</p>
      <p>"Sure," I chuckled grabbing my wallet, removing my lab coat and draping it over a chair.</p>
      <p>"To the ice cream parlor we go!" He exclaimed opening the door he was kneeling by.</p>
      <p>We walked to the ice cream parlor, as we walked alot of the people made way for us their eyes full of fear.</p>
      <p>"The joy making wepons." I rolled my eyes glaring at a small child that was tugging on my sleeve.</p>
      <p>My face softened as I saw the tears in her eyes. "What's wrong little one?" I asked crouching down to her height.</p>
      <p>"M-my mommy and daddy l-left me!" She hicked looking at me with sorrow filled eyes.</p>
      <p>"Do you know why?" I asked my voice soft and caring. A voice I only use with my younger brother.</p>
      <p>"Th-they said I was a disgrace to the family," She sobbed fresh tears spilling down her soft cheeks.</p>
      <p>I wiped the tears off her face and ruffled her long blonde hair, "You can stay with me and my little brother Gavin if you like," I told her smiling</p>
      <p>"Yeah that sounds great!" She exclaimed beaming at me.</p>
      <p>I picked her up and jogged to catch up to Cyrus. "Carter! Where were you!" Cyrus demanded stamping his foot. One of the mothers standing by him flinched and pulled her child closer to her.</p>
      <p>"Sorry I was busy helping this ball of cuteness!" I said happily throwing her into the air and catching her again. She let out squeal of exitment as I spun her around.</p>
      <p>"So you are a big softie Carter." He chuckled.</p>
      <p>"Oh shut it or you're not getting ice cream!" I yelled speeding down the street, Cyrus clamped his jaw shut.</p>
      <p>"We're getting ice cream?" The girl asked her eyes twinkling.</p>
      <p>"Yup, but only because Cyrus begged to go," I told her, sending a cold glare twords the brunett next to me.</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry, I just needed some sugar coursing through my veins." Me and the blonde chuckled and I slammed open the door to the family owned parlor.</p>
      <p>Every one in the small building with small children pulled them closer. One mother was clutching her sons hand so tight her knuckes turned white. I expelled a loud laugh that cut through the ari like an arrow.</p>
      <p>For the fun of it I sent a snarl to a family of four. The mother wrapped her arms around the baby and the father pulled the little boy into his chest his broad shoulders squared.</p>
      <p>"Leave them be Carter." A hand was placed on my shoulder and Cyrus dragged me over to the counter.</p>
      <p>"Sheesh, can I not have the tinyest bit of fun?" I sighed</p>
