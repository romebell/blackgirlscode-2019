  <h1>Black Girls CODE Presents: #SummerOfCode2019!﻿﻿</h1>
  <p id="mission"><span id="vision">Our Vision</span>: To increase the number of women of color in the digital 
    space by empowering girls of color ages 7 to 17 to become innovators 
    in STEM fields, leaders in their communities, and builders of their 
    own futures through exposure to computer science and technology. To 
    provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 
    1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. 
    by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040.</p>
